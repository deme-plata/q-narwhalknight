# Q-NarwhalKnight v0.0.1-alpha

🌟 **Quantum-Enhanced DAG-BFT Consensus with Post-Quantum Cryptography**

Q-NarwhalKnight is a revolutionary blockchain consensus system that combines the efficiency of DAG-Knight consensus with Narwhal mempool and quantum-ready cryptographic primitives. This implementation provides a phased approach to quantum-resistance, starting with classical cryptography (Phase 0) and progressively upgrading to full quantum protocols (Phase 4).

## 🔬 Architecture Overview

Q-NarwhalKnight implements a four-tier quantum threat model with seamless cryptographic agility:

### Phase 0: Classical Foundation (Current Implementation)
- **Consensus**: DAG-Knight with quantum-enhanced anchor election
- **Mempool**: Narwhal with reliable broadcast (Bracha's protocol)
- **Networking**: libp2p with Ed25519 + QUIC transport
- **Ordering**: Zero-message complexity BFT with VDF-based randomness

### Phase 1: Post-Quantum Transition (Implemented)
- **Crypto-Agile Framework**: Seamless algorithm negotiation
- **Signatures**: Dilithium5 (post-quantum digital signatures)  
- **Key Exchange**: Kyber1024 (post-quantum KEM)
- **Hybrid Security**: Classical + post-quantum dual protection

### Phase 2-4: Quantum Future (Planned)
- **Quantum Random Number Generation** (QRNG)
- **Quantum Key Distribution** (QKD) networking
- **Lattice-based Verifiable Random Functions**
- **STARK-only zkVM for quantum-resistant proofs**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ with Cargo
- libp2p networking stack
- Optional: PostgreSQL for persistent storage

### Build & Run
```bash
# Clone the repository (hosted on our self-managed Git server)
git clone https://code.quillon.xyz/dagknight/q-narwhalknight.git
cd q-narwhalknight

# Build the workspace
cargo build --release

# Run the API server
cargo run --bin q-api-server

# Run consensus node
cargo run --bin q-dag-knight-node
```

> **Note:** The repository is hosted on [code.quillon.xyz](https://code.quillon.xyz/dagknight/q-narwhalknight) because the codebase exceeds the size limits of traditional public forges. Using our own Git server ensures faster cloning and reliable access to large assets.

### Configuration
```toml
[network]
listen_addr = "/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/7000"
bootstrap_peers = []

[consensus]
node_id = "auto" # Or specify 32-byte hex
byzantine_tolerance = 1 # f parameter (supports up to 3f+1 total nodes)
delta_rounds = 4 # Commit latency parameter

[crypto]
phase = "Phase0" # "Phase0" | "Phase1" 
auto_upgrade = true
```
